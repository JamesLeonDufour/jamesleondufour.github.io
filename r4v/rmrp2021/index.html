                                        The flight of Venezuelans is the largest in the recent history of Latin America and the Caribbean. As of October 2020, more than 5.5 million refugees and migrants from Venezuela are outside their country of origin, with 4.5 million in the region alone. In this context, the Refugee and Migrant Response Plan 2021 is the result of field-driven planning, bringing together 158 appealing organizations in 17 countries, in consultation with host governments, civil society and faith-based organizations, local communities, donors, as well as the refugees and migrants themselves, with the common objective of addressing the overarching humanitarian, protection and socioeconomic integration needs of refugees and migrants from Venezuela.

    <div class="container">
        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organi¬zation (WHO) declared the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a public emergency of international concern under the International Health Regu¬lations (IHR 2005). On 4 February 2020, WHO requested the activation of the UN Crisis Management Team to coordinate UN system-wide scale-up to assist countries prepare for, and respond to, COVID-19. 
</p><p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the review of the RMRP 2020 was conducted by all Platforms, Sectors and R4V partners taking in consider¬ation the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on refugees, migrants and host communities living in the region especially. 
</p><p>With the spread of COVID-19 in the region, refugees and migrants, includ¬ing particularly those in irregular situations, are at a high risk of being left out of health and social welfare programs, thereby becoming even more vulnerable to a range of health and protection risks. Moreover, many fam¬ilies and individuals amongst the refugee and migrant populations who have lost their livelihoods are exposed to increasing levels of discrimina¬tion, violence, exploitation and abuse.
</p><p>In a region characterized by high levels of informal labour, the im¬plementation of curfews and other movement restrictions has had a disproportionately grave impact on refugees and migrants. Without savings or alternative social safety nets, the loss of employment has resulted in many being unable to cover their rent. As a result, the past month has seen a spike in the levels of evictions, and subsequent homelessness and destitution of refugees and migrants.
</p><p>Many Venezuelan refugees and migrants are now unable to cover regular basic needs such as shelter, food, hygiene and healthcare needs, and are equally unable to comply with the quarantine measures and social dis¬tancing. An increasing number of Venezuelans are left with no alternative but to consider returning to Venezuela in an unregulated and potentially perilous manner that poses significant additional protection and health risks for the region at large. Incidents of xenophobia and stigmatization by host communities, including negative perceptions associated with a fear of the spreading virus, have further aggravated the situation of refugees and migrants, and impede their integration. 
</p><p>Overstretched public health services are expected to be challenged in 2020 throughout the region. Availability of hygiene items and personal protective equipment is a challenge for people on the move, as well as re¬sponse actors. In these conditions, unimpeded access by refugees and mi¬grants, many of which are already in very vulnerable situations, to health and sanitary facilities will be key, also for containing the virus. 
</p><p>Food insecurity and poor nutrition levels among refugees and migrants have been reported, especially among those having lost their livelihoods. This indi¬rect health impact is particularly serious for those with specific needs. 
</p><p>Resulting from prolonged confinement and isolation, risks and prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV) have exacerbated, impacting especially wom¬en and children in violent relationships. With schools and universities closed across the region, education of children and youth is of rising concern as many refugees and migrants have limited capacities to access on-line school¬ing and other forms of education currently available for nationals.
</p><p>With everyone being at risk, the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Plat¬form (R4V) promotes a comprehensive “whole of society” approach. In that context, the R4V response advocates for full inclusion of refugees and migrants in the national COVID-19 responses of the 17 countries covered by the RMRP. Resulting from such advocacy good practices have been adopted by some governments in the region and include: a suspen¬sion of evictions and systematic exemptions from movement restrictions for humanitarian responders in Colombia, measures to remotely extend legal stay arrangements in Argentina and Ecuador, provision of emergency basic financial assistance in Aruba, Brazil and Costa Rica, and the access to COVID-19 testing and treatment in most countries.
</p><p>As part of the emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a re¬view of the RMRP has been undertaken, taking into account particular COVID-19-related needs and priorities of host governments. A particular focus of this review and reprioritization has been on responding to refu¬gees’ and migrants’ particular needs in the areas of Health, Protection, Shelter, WASH, Nutrition, Food, and Livelihoods and Integration, through targeted and context-sensitive interventions (such as through enhanced cash assistance) to complement national authorities’ response capacities.
