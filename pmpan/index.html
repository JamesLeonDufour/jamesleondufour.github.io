The refugee population is mainly composed of persons from Colombia, El Salvador, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. During the COVID-19 pandemic, refugees and asylum seekers in Panama have faced new and exacerbated risks; especially with the loss of opportunities to generate an income, daily subsistence has become a challenge.  
</p><p>In March of 2020, the Panamanian government adopted the Cabinet Resolution No. 11, through which the National Emergency State was declared as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions on mobility and other sanitary measures were adopted as a means of preventing the spread of the disease and further contagion of the population within the national territory.
</p><p>UNHCR conducted a protection monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic context, emphasizing the impact and consequences that the restrictions adopted had on refugees and asylum seekers. The results shed light on the protection risks faced by the persons of concern (PoCs) due to the limited access to rights and services during the pandemic context. 
</p><p>The protection monitoring was conducted remotely via phone interviews to 435 households from October 21st to December 31st, 2020. The questionnaire addressed the respondents’ access to basic needs and services, access to rights, coping mechanisms, and main impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis on the households’ overall situation.

The surveyed persons who reported incidents in Panama generally expressed they had not presented the pertinent complaints, because many times the perpetrator was a member of the same community or knew the victim; on occasions, the interviewees received threats not to continue with legal processes regarding the cases that occurred. In other instances, the perpetrators identified by the surveyed persons were part of the security forces, mainly the National Police, for which the victims commented that they did not have the necessary sense of protection to make the corresponding complaints.

</strong><br>The prolonged confinement, mobility restrictions, curfews and other sanitary measures imposed by the Panamanian government did not only impact the economy and access to basic needs and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on social interactions, family dynamics and personal wellbeing. The mental health issues that surfaced during this health crisis context were evidenced by respondents’ reports, partners’ support programs and State’s actions directed at mitigating risks.&nbsp;<br></p>

The low numbers of surveyed persons who have accessed psycho-emotional support programs may not be a true reflection of the need for mental health services, but of the stigma this topic still holds.

</p><p>In terms of services provided, interviewees mentioned in many cases that they had received psychosocial support from Partners such as HIAS, the Panamanian Red Cross, and RET International; legal assistance and representation, from NRC; digital connectivity assistance from HIAS and RET International; and access to training opportunities from HIAS.
