PATTRN is an open source project hosted at  [Goldsmiths, University of London](http://www.gold.ac.uk/).

It originates in the work of  [Forensic Architecture](http://www.forensic-architecture.org/),
a research consultancy undertaking spatial and media analysis for the investigation of human rights violations.

The PATTRN project was initiated thanks to a Proof-of-Concept Grant from the [European Research Council](https://erc.europa.eu/),
awarded to Prof. Eyal Weizman, in the framework of Forensic Architecture (2015-2015).
