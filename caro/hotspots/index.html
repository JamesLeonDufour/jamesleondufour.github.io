    <h1>American Museum of Natural History</h1>
    <h2>One of the largest museums in the world</h2>
    <p>The museum has many mammal halls, including the Akeley Hall of African Mammals and the Whitney Memorial Hall of Oceanic Birds.</p>

    <p>The 360 video below shows the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life.</p>

    <div id="vrview"></div>

    <p>The hall is most famous for its 94-foot (29 m)-long blue whale model, suspended from the ceiling behind its dorsal fin. The hall's classic lines and visually arresting elegance host cutting-edge exhibition technology and the latest scientific research on the ocean.</p>

    <p>The 29,000-square-foot Hall has been transformed into a fully immersive marine environment with high-definition video projections, interactive computer stations, hands-on models, 14 renovated classic dioramas, and eight new ocean ecosystem displays that transport visitors from the rainbow-hued profusion of life in the Indo-Pacific coral reefs to the flickering bioluminescence of fishes in the eerie darkness of the deep sea.</p>
